# MIP-4: Red Bank Deposit Rewards

## Proposal Authors

Delphi Labs

## Summary

This proposal aims to 1) obtain 1M MARS from the community pool funds and 2) use these funds to reward deposits of the following assets into Red Bank for 30 days: ATOM, OSMO and axlUSDC.

## Abstract

The objective of this proposal is to reward early users of the “Red Bank” feature of the Mars Protocol with governance power to ensure that they have a strong voice in the parameterization of the Mars protocol in the future. In order to do so, such users will be rewarded with MARS tokens as set forth herein.

## Motivation

This proposal intends to kickstart interest and activity in the Red Bank by rewarding the deposits of OSMO, ATOM, and axlUSDC into the Red Bank.

## Specification

This rewards program sets out the distribution of rewards for each of the three assets listed on Red Bank.

Asset	Deposit Rewards [MARS]
OSMO	600k
ATOM	275k
axlUSDC	125k

| Asset  | Deposit Rewards (MARS)  |
|---|---|
| OSMO  | 600k  |
| ATOM  | 275k  |
| axlUSDC  | 125k  |

## Risks

There is no guarantee that MARS recipients retain their MARS or use it in governance.

## Implementation

This rewards program will commence upon the launch of Red Bank. The duration of this program is strictly for 30 days only.

The MARS community fund is held on the Mars Hub blockchain. Accordingly, if the proposal is approved, the required MARS would be IBC’d to Osmosis from the Mars Hub and directed to the MARS rewards contract ‘incentives’ contract.
