# MIP-2: Osmosis LP Rewards

## Proposal Authors

Delphi Labs

## Summary

This proposal aims to 1) obtain 750k MARS from the community pool funds and 2) use these funds to reward liquidity providers on the MARS-OSMO pool on the Osmosis Dex for a period of 1 month.

## Abstract

We propose to reward MARS-OSMO liquidity providers on the Osmosis Dex to the sum of 750,000 MARS for 1 month. We also propose here that the Mars Community pool fund this expense.

## Motivation

This LP reward program is designed to increase the MARS governance stake of persons who contribute to the functioning of the Mars ecosystem by staking in MARS AMM pools (LPs)–thus making MARS readily available for those who wish to use it in the Mars ecosystem. As this forum post 6 on commonwealth indicates, the Osmosis community pool and incentives pool are also intended to provide OSMO rewards to such LPs.

## Specification

The objective of this LP reward program is to target a MARS-OSMO pool liquidity of approximately 30% of circulating supply at launch.

To do so, we propose the community pool provide 750k MARS to provide linearly distributed rewards to MARS-OSMO LPs for a month.

We expect this program to attract enough liquidity to this pool that would allow for better price discovery at this initial stage.

This LP rewards program is strictly for those LPs that have bonded for 14 days.

## Risks

Risks involved in the proposal may include, among others::

The proportion of the circulating supply targeted to be bonded could fall short of the intended target
LPs might fail to bond for 14 days and instead bond for a reduced period.
In the event either of these 2 risks manifest, additional MIPs should be submitted to amend the reward staking program.

## Implementation

The MARS community fund is held on the Mars Hub blockchain. Accordingly, if the proposal is approved, the required MARS would be IBC’d from the Mars Hub to the appropriate Osmosis external gauge.
