## Summary

Delphi Labs proposes to list ANC as a collateral asset for lending and borrowing on the Red Bank.



## Motivation

Anchor is a savings protocol built on top of Terra. The main objective of Anchor is to offer depositors stable interest rates. To accomplish this, borrowers first deposit liquid staking derivatives, referred to as bAssets, as collateral before they can borrow UST. The staking yield generated by the bAssets and the interest charged to borrowers is used to pay this stable rate to lenders.

The Anchor Token (ANC) is Anchor Protocol’s governance token. ANC captures a portion of Anchor’s yield, and is also used as incentives to bootstrap borrow demand.

Out of all the dApps on Terra, Anchor’s token has the highest market capitalization, standing at ~$700m at the time of writing. Listing the ANC token would bring a flow of liquidity and TVL in the form of ANC tokens as collateral to borrow against it. Ultimately, this will generate more fees for Mars as the demand for borrowing assets increases.

Currently, the yield generation strategies on Mars entail that Mars’ users provide liquidity to certain liquidity pools on Astroport. If ANC is listed on Mars, token holders will be able to earn additional yield with a different risk profile from the risks associated with providing liquidity on a DEX.

## New Asset Market Risk

Following the [Red Bank Risk Framework ](https://docs.marsprotocol.io/mars-protocol/protocol/welcome-to-mars/red-bank-risk-framework), we calculated the following market risk metrics and scores:

* Maximum intraday drawdown: - 31%
* Volatility: 8.6%
* 24hr volume: $58.71M
* Worst 7-day volume: $5.68M

The above metrics lead to the following scores:

|Ticker|1D Worst Drawdown (1y)|Volatility (90d)|Volumes (90d 24hr avg.)|Volumes (Worst week 1yr)|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|ANC|C|C|C|D|

## New Asset Technical Risk

Different parts of the contracts have been audited as follows:

* [Anchor Protocol Smart Contracts - Audit Report](https://anchorprotocol.com/docs/Audit%20Report%20-%20Anchor%20Protocol%20%5B20210308%5D.pdf) by[ Cryptonics](https://cryptonics.consulting)
* [Anchor Token and Distributions Smart Contracts - Audit Report](https://anchorprotocol.com/docs/Audit%20Report%20-%20Anchor%20Protocol%20%5B20210406%5D.pdf) by[ Cryptonics](https://cryptonics.consulting)
* [EthAnchor - Audit Report](https://anchorprotocol.com/docs/Audit%20Report%20-%20EthAnchor%20%5B09.07.2021%5D.pdf) by[ Solidified](https://solidified.io)

Furthermore, the protocol has been live for over a year and during that time the protocol has accumulated significant TVL without experiencing any security issues. Specifically, we calculate the honey pot coefficient at >4.04 ([more on this metric here ](https://docs.marsprotocol.io/mars-protocol/protocol/welcome-to-mars/red-bank-risk-framework)), which suggests the protocol has supported high levels of TVL since launch.

Note: Data taken to calculate the honey pot coefficient above is taken from defillama which shows TVL reflecting data from 22 April 2021 to 22 March 2022.

In terms of the quality of the smart contracts, we find that they were written using standard reference contracts provided by the CosmWasm team with very minimal modifications. These have been battle-tested by many protocols over a long period of time. Regarding testing, however, the smart contracts did not include testing scripts so we could not assess how the tests were conducted.

Other relevant links:

* GitHub page where source code is hosted.
  * [Anchor Protocol · GitHub ](https://github.com/Anchor-Protocol)
* On-chain contracts.
  * Terra14z56l0fp2lsf86zy3hty2z47ezkhnthtr9yq76

Given the above, we suggest the following scores:

|Ticker|Honey Pot|Time since launch|# of SC audits|Quality of SCs|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|ANC|A|B|B|A|

## Centralization Risk

* Smart contracts upgradability: Anchor currently has a multisig in place that can upgrade the protocol’s smart contracts and is controlled by members of the Anchor team. There is a plan in place to change this to a DAO process.
* Team: Anchor Protocol is built by Terraform Labs (TFL). TFL created the Terra blockchain. TFL is a widely known and highly respected team that has been building in the space for several years.

Given the above we suggest the following scores:

|Ticker|Permission/Trust|Key Contracts Centralization|
| --- | --- | --- |
|ANC|A|D|

### Oracle risk
We propose that this asset uses the ANC-UST Astroport pool as the basis for a TWAP oracle. This pool should be safe enough to use for a TWAP given its significant levels of liquidity:

* Current liquidity: $151.03M
* Past 30 days average liquidity: $251.91M
* Past 60 days average liquidity: $199.32M

These levels of liquidity would make manipulation attacks highly costly and thus, unlikely. For further research on this topic please refer to [this piece](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/attack-cost-and-profit-from-manipulating-constant-product-market-maker-twap-oracles-in-defi-protocols/) by Delphi Labs.

For the specific implementation of the TWAP we propose using the [Mars TWAP](https://github.com/mars-protocol/mars-core/tree/master/contracts/mars-oracle) (same implementation being used on Fields) with the following parameters:

* Window: 32 minutes
* Tolerance: 2 minutes

## Risk Parameters Suggestion

Following the methodology provided in the [Red Bank Asset Listing Risk Framework ](https://docs.marsprotocol.io/mars-protocol/protocol/welcome-to-mars/red-bank-risk-framework) we propose the following risk parameters:

* Loan-to-Value: 40%
* Liquidation Threshold: 50%
* Liquidation Bonus: 15%
* Interest Rate Model: This asset will use a 2-slope (kinked) interest rate implementation with the following parameters:
  * Base Rate (interest rate at 0% utilization): 0%
  * Slope 1: 7%
  * Slope 2: 300%
  * Optimal utilization: 45%
* Whether the asset will be usable as collateral: Yes
