# MIP-1: Mars Hub Staking Rewards

## Proposal Authors

Delphi Labs

## Summary

This proposal aims to 1) obtain 9M MARS from the community pool funds and 2) Use these MARS to help secure the Mars Hub by rewarding Mars Hub stakers for a period of 12 months.

## Abstract

We propose here that Mars Hub stakers are collectively rewarded 750,000 MARS per month for a total of 12 months (i.e. a total of 9M MARS). We also propose here that the Mars Community approve a spend of 9M Mars from the Mars Community pool to fund these rewards.

## Motivation

Protocol revenue at launch will likely be low and so the rewards to stakers will also be low. To ensure the integrity of Mars Hub isn’t compromised, validators and stakers need to be rewarded well (in the form of additional Mars governance power through MARS) to foster a secure and healthy validator ecosystem.

## Specification

It is proposed that 12 months of rewards be implemented pursuant to this proposal.These MARS rewards would be taken from the community pool on Mars Hub and rewarded directly to validators/stakers on the Mars Hub.

## Risks

The main risk associated with this proposal is that the proposed rewards could be insufficient to create the targeted level of security. In the event this were to occur, additional MIPs should be submitted to amend the incentivised staking program

## Implementation

This proposal, if successful, will be binding and enforced as it requires only on-chain infrastructure and can be implemented automatically upon the voting period elapsing. To do so, the MsgCreateSchedule message shall be executed. This will automatically obtain the required funds from the community pool and distribute the rewards to stakers every block
